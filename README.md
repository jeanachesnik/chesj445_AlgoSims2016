##Progress Update
FML - I ran into some issues again with my Xcode and ended up troubleshooting for two hours and deleting and redownloading everything. I'm going to continue to experiment with different types of movement tomorrow and throughout the weekend. I really want to try and make something unique. Below are my notes from my Prototype10 example which is where I finalized today. Last week Protoype5 is what I showed in class so you can see where I was originally. I'll upload each prototype so you can see some of the errors that I ran into. See you next Thursday 

Notes from Prototype 10 File
I started to experiment with some movement with this prototype. I was able to use an example from the Openframeworks book titled Mastering openFrameworks. I was trying to build upon my mesh example from last week, but I ran into some errors with my XCode again. I spent two hours trouble shooting it and began again from scratch. I'm going to try and return to the mesh example and add experiment some more to find out which version will replicate the movement I'm striving for.



##Final Assignment 2 
For my final project I was inspired by the film Before the Flood. Before the Flood is a documentary discussing the devastating effects of climate change. Towards the end of the movie there is a real time interactive map that displays various temperatures throughout the planet. This map is in constant flux with the increasing temperatures and displays colorful displays of heat and cool air throughout the world. Instead of creating a map with real time data, I'd like to create how I view the map artistically. I'd like to experiment with the same color palaettes as the original map. If possible, I'd like to create an art piece that flows in the beginning very calmly but eventually dissaperates or melts off of the screen altogether. I want to create something that is beautiful but that also drives home my fear and concerns about climate change.

#Week 11
I'm having to I worked with some of the code from the openFrameworks examples folder to experiment with shaders. I was able to play around with the color, but I still needed to reference the notes from the examples to see if I could recreate some myself. 

##Week 10 
I also used some of the examples from the openFrameworks for this assignment when working with mesh. I tried to upload an image, but I ran into some issues. Instead I tried to use the original code of the EasyCam with a live image that would be maniupulated by a mesh. I decided to experiment with the colors of the mesh to make it a little more bright and abstract.
