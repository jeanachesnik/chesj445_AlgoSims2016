##Week 12 
For my final project I was inspired by the film Before the Flood. Before the Flood is a documentary discussing the devastating effects of climate change. Towards the end of the movie there is a real time interactive map that displays various temperatures throughout the planet. This map is in constant flux with the increasing temperatures and displays colorful displays of heat and cool air throughout the world.

#Week 11
I'm having to I worked with some of the code from the openFrameworks examples folder to experiment with shaders. I was able to play around with the color, but I still needed to reference the notes from the examples to see if I could recreate some myself. 

##Week 10 
I also used some of the examples from the openFrameworks for this assignment when working with mesh. I tried to upload an image, but I ran into some issues. Instead I tried to use the original code of the EasyCam with a live image that would be maniupulated by a mesh. I decided to experiment with the colors of the mesh to make it a little more bright and abstract.
