##Week 6

Regina - I tried the workflow to build my projects that we went over yesterday, but I'm still having issues when transferring them to my folders. I included my entire MyApps folder so you could see that one project works inside there, but doesn't work when I copy and paste it over into the folder that's formatted wk06_hwA_v3_chesj44 I'm going to keep working on some of this today, but if I'm still having problems then I'm going to try and get moving on the midterm. Thank you for all your help.
