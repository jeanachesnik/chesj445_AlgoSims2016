Regina - I apologize for my file structure. I'm having to upload directly to the GitHub from my browser in order to share my homework. I think this is why for last week's homework there were some files missing. I have to upload each homework attempt individually instead of keeping them in the organized folder by each week. I'll try and fix this before class on Thrusday so it's easier for you to review the homework.

#Week 11
I'm having to I worked with some of the code from the openFrameworks examples folder to experiment with shaders. I was able to play around with the color, but I still needed to reference the notes from the examples to see if I could recreate some myself. 

##Week 10 
I also used some of the examples from the openFrameworks for this assignment when working with mesh. I tried to upload an image, but I ran into some issues. Instead I tried to use the original code of the EasyCam with a live image that would be maniupulated by a mesh. I decided to experiment with the colors of the mesh to make it a little more bright and abstract.
