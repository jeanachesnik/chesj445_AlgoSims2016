##Creative Coding Midterm 


Inspiration: Flora & The Flamingo


For my midterm my inspiration is one of my neices favorite children's books, Flora and the Flamingo. I would like to use code from the videograbber to mimic my actions on the screen. I would like to create an abstract flamingo that will mimick my actions similar to the storyline of the book. I've reached out to some members of the of Meetup to see if they would be able to share with me some code on how they used videograbber. They  have been so helpful and even suggested using face or skelton tracker to help with midterm. I will try and incorporate these face tracker and videograbber to see if I can accomplish this midterm assignment.  '
