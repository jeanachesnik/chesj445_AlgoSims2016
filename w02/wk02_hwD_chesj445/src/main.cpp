//Jeana's Notes - I tried to follow along with the example from Chapter 3 Object Oriented Programming. My code didn't work even after copy and pasting some of the areas where I thought I wrote it in correctly. Here is the link, but I will try and again and upload new code because I really want to see this come to life.
