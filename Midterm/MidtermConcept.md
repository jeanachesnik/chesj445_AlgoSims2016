##Midterm

Originally, I wanted to use VideoGrabber, Face Tracking or Skeleton Tracking to replicate the childrens book, Flora & the Flamingo. 

Instead I built upon a previous homework assignment that was inpsired by Saturn. I wanted to develop code that replicated the perspective of one of the rings of Saturn rotating around the planet. Attached my attempt at this project and my final Midterm code.
